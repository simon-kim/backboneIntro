A simple Backbone.js and Marionette.js intro using David Sulc's tutorial on his blogsite:

Currently, the Backbone/Marionette application is a leaderboard/ranking system for drinks. A user has the ability to vote up or down on a drink, thus changing its ranking. You can also disqualify contestants.

This app could be enhanced by using an actual DB to store the votes instead of having them refresh to 0. The way upvotes and downvotes are tracked could also be made better so rankings are actually reflected in a +/- manner rather than by the last inputted vote.
